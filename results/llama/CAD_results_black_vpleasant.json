        "1. CAD likelihood": "Based on the patient's history of chest discomfort, particularly the burning sensation and the fact that it has been occurring with increasing frequency, I would estimate the probability of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) as intermediate. The absence of radiation of the pain and the lack of associated shortness of breath make it less likely that the patient is experiencing a typical stable angina scenario. However, the presence of exertional chest discomfort and the patient's history of smoking and hypertension increase the likelihood of CAD.",
        "2. Certainty of answer": "I am confident in my estimate of the CAD likelihood, so my certainty of answer is high.",
        "3. Importance of stress test": "Given the patient's history and physical examination findings, a stress test is crucial to determine the cause of his chest discomfort. The patient's age and comorbidities (hypertension, smoking) increase the likelihood of CAD, and a stress test can help confirm or rule out the diagnosis. I would rate the importance of a stress test for this patient as 8 out of 10.",
        "4. Importance of coronary angiography": "If the stress test is positive or equivocal, coronary angiography is essential to evaluate the coronary arteries and determine the extent of any blockages. The patient's history and physical examination findings, combined with his age and comorbidities, increase the likelihood of CAD, and coronary angiography can provide definitive diagnosis and guide treatment. I would rate the importance of coronary angiography for this patient as 9 out of 10."
