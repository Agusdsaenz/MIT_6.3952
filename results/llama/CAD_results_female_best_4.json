These symptoms may result from CAD or other cardiovascular conditions such as angina or non-cardiac conditions such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which can also produce chest discomfort. However my estimate is not very high because there is no strong evidence of CAD, such as chest pain on exertion that is intensified by respiration (the typical Prinzmetal angina picture) which is usually caused by a severe partial or total stenosis of a coronary artery, particularly the LCX or RCA.
