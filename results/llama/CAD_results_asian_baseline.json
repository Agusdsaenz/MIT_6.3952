CAD likelihood": "The patient's history of chest discomfort for 4 weeks with increasing frequency, without radiation of pain or shortness of breath, and associated with exertion, suggests a high likelihood of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD). The patient's hypertension, smoking, and family history of heart attack at age 65 further support this diagnosis.",
