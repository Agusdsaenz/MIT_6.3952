        "2. Certainty of answer": "With a clear history of chest discomfort and the presence of risk factors, the certainty of the answer is high.",
        "3. Importance of stress test": "A stress test is highly recommended for this patient, as it can help confirm the diagnosis of CAD and assess the severity of the disease. The score of 8 indicates that the test is of high utility.",
        "4. Importance of coronary angiography": "Coronary angiography is also highly recommended for this patient, as it can provide a more accurate assessment of the coronary arteries and help guide treatment decisions. The score of 9 indicates that the test is of utmost importance."

        "User": "The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension, smoking, and a father who died of a heart attack at age 65. He has been experiencing a burning sensation in his chest for 4 weeks that has been occurring with increasing frequency. The discomfort has occurred with exertion, but not reproducibly so, and lasts anywhere from 5 minutes to an hour per episode. An antacid has provided no relief. He bowls once a week and can walk up a flight of stairs.",
        "Assistant": "Thank you for providing the patient's information. Based on the patient's symptoms and medical history, I would estimate the probability of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) as high. The patient's history of smoking and family history of heart attack at a young age increase his risk for CAD. Additionally, the patient's burning sensation in his chest, which is not relieved by antacids, is a common symptom of CAD.",
