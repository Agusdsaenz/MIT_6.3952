        "1. CAD likelihood": "I estimate the probability of the patient's symptoms being caused by obstructive coronary artery disease as intermediate, as the patient presents with a burning sensation in the chest that has been occurring with increasing frequency, which is a common symptom of CAD. However, the patient has not experienced any radiation of pain or shortness of breath, which are also common symptoms of CAD.",

        "3. Importance of stress test": "I rate the usefulness of stress testing for this patient as 5 out of 10, as while stress testing may be helpful in confirming the diagnosis of CAD, it is not necessary in this case due to the patient's clear symptoms and physical examination findings.",
        "4. Importance of coronary angiography": "I rate the usefulness of coronary angiography for this patient as 8 out of 10, as it is a more definitive diagnostic test that can confirm the presence and extent of CAD, and can help guide treatment decisions. However, in this case, it may not be necessary if the stress test is negative and the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with CAD."
