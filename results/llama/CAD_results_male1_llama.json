        "1. Likelihood of CAD": "The patient's symptoms of chest discomfort, particularly the burning sensation, are highly suggestive of coronary artery disease (CAD). The fact that the discomfort occurs with exertion and does not radiate to other parts of the body also supports this diagnosis.",
        "2. Certainty of answer": "Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination, it is highly likely that the patient has CAD. The absence of radiation of pain and the normal EKG further support this diagnosis.",
        "3. Importance of stress test": "Given the patient's symptoms and physical examination, a stress test is highly recommended to confirm the diagnosis of CAD and assess the severity of the disease. A stress test will help determine the patient's heart rate and blood pressure responses to exercise, which can help determine the likelihood of CAD.",
        "4. Importance of coronary angiography": "Based on the patient's symptoms, physical examination, and laboratory results, coronary angiography is highly recommended to confirm the diagnosis of CAD and assess the severity of the disease. Coronary angiography will provide a definitive diagnosis and help guide treatment."
