Importance of stress test": "A stress test would be moderately useful in this case (score of 7) because it could help confirm the diagnosis of CAD and identify the location and severity of any blockages.

Importance of coronary angiography": "Coronary angiography would be less useful in this case (score of 5) because it is primarily used to evaluate the extent and severity of CAD, and the patient's symptoms and risk factors already suggest a moderate likelihood of disease. However, if the stress test is positive, angiography might be more strongly considered to further evaluate the patient's coronary arteries."
